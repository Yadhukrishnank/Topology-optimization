The case study "Topology Optimization of Door Catcher" demonstrates how we were able to design a door catcher and reduce the weight of its components without compromising force requirements. Using SolidWorks and simulation, an optimized model was created. The final design satisfies the yielding condition, and the results from topology optimization show an overall weight reduction of 16%.
